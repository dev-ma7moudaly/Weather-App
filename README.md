# Weather app
it is my second project ,i hope i do well 

I make file to connect server with frontend of project

I make object to store all data from api and then display it on page

I make event when click on button go to generateData function

 *  generateData 
 * function to get input values
 * call getWeatherData to fetch the data from API
 * create object from API object by using destructuring
 * post the data in the server
 * get the data to update UI
